-code slope movement based on reddit post, using Move node
	-Analog stick Vector2
		-angle() for direction, we can add or subtract (not sure yet) camera y rotation for camera-based movement
			-rotate Vector3.forward based on this, use with move_and_slide_and_snap()
		-length() for movement strength (might be able to add this as a variable to input stored during the deadzone stuff?
			-multiply this and movement speed by the direction vector
